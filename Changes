	Tests:

	call would need to be wrapped in a BEGIN block or similar.

	Features:
	* Mixin::Event::Dispatch::Methods for importing without inheriting
	* Removed mention of ->trace_events_for, this was removed a while ago
	due to performance issues anyway

1.000     2012-09-22 11:52:51 Europe/London
	Provide Mixin::Event::Dispatch::Event class and a more advanced observer
